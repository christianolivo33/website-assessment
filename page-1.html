        <h2>My Name</h2>
        <p>Hello, my name is <strong>Christian Olivo</strong>, I am a Father of three, a husband to my beautiful wife
            and I am currently a student at <strong>App Academy</strong>
            where I yearn to become a Software Engineer. </p>
        <h2>My Journey</h2>
        <p>What can I say? Like many of us I come from humble beginnings and I have a lot I can say about how I got to
            where i'm at today. I believe I can ellaborate by explaining what i've learned rather than the occurences
            thats happened in my life.</p>
        <p>Through loss I've learned how to gain, though many people may not have
            stuck around I learned to cherish memories for what they are. I learned that a heartbreak can set you up for
            personal growth, and that love is all you need.</p>
        <h2>My Goal</h2>
        <p>I have plenty of goals which include becoming a Software Engineer for a big tech company one day and owning
            my own business. </p>
